Introduction


This exercise is intended to test your web design, layout and programming ability. As far as is possible, it intends to replicate a normal work assignment. It will be judged more on the quality of the work and functionality that has been completed, rather than the volume of code that is submitted. 


The Task

Use your imagination and expertise to create a seamless responsive web app. The output of the task is not intended to be a complete finished product, but it will be assessed as an initial prototype. The code behind it though should be as close to production quality code as can be achieved in the time available. 


The goal of the task is to provide to the user a simple webpage where they can login/signup and check their delegations (extra points if you manage to present the user rewards). 

The networks that you should use for this challenge are Matic/Polygon and Solana.

The project should contain the following: 

Frontend:
login/signup page;
home page;
 Backend:
User Registration (email, password);
User address and network

The Resources 

Feel free to use whatever technologies you feel more comfortable with, no need to stick with a specific framework.
